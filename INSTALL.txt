Use this template to produce a project report that meets the Oxford University
Department of Computer Science requirements for part B and part C projects, and
should be adaptable for other STEM department projects as well.

In modern LaTeX implementations, you should be able to open Project.tex with
your favorite editor and compile it.  By default, this template uses biber/BibLaTeX
for references / citations, so you may have to make the appropriate changes in
your build preferences.  A typical 'full build' should be:
1. pdflatex Project.tex
2. biber Project
3. pdflatex Project.tex
4. pdflatex Project.tex

Alternatively, consider using OverLeaf, an online LaTeX editor, to allow for an easy
and self-contained LaTeX development environment that can be easily accessed and 
reviewed by your supervisors

There should be subfolders called 'text' and 'figures'.  Keep all your work in these
folders.  This will make your life much simpler when you need to go about deleting
files creating while compiling while not deleting your actual thesis.

Make a new .tex file for each section and appendix, and place them in the 'text'
folder.  If you'll have a figure-intensive thesis, subfolders in 'figures' is a good
idea.  Use PDF graphics if at all possible.

The LaTeX cheat sheet is your friend.  Google it.  http://tex.stackexchange.com has
lots of answers to common LaTeX problems.

See the readme for further details of what this template provides, or just dive in
and get familiar with how it all works
