% TODO - The noIndentBlock terminates on a .cls but not on a .tex

% I've (John) tried to comment this file extensively, so read through it to see how to use the
% various options. Remember that in LaTeX, any line starting with a % is NOT executed. Several
% places below, you have a choice of which line to use out of multiple options (eg draft vs final,
% for PDF vs for binding, etc.) When you pick one, add a % to the beginning of the lines you don't
% want.

% I (Ned) found John's comments extremely helpful. You likely will too, and I've tried to similarly
% explain my additions to this template. However converting to the version you have before you was
% quite a change, so some of John's comments may not make sense to you. In that case, you're
% welcome to raise an issue on the GitHub or, better yet, come up with a better explanation and
% make a pull request to help all those that come after you, as I aim to do here.

% NS - Should you need to render for a different paper size (e.g., letter), you can change it here.
% You should also add the "final" option to render your project ready for submission.
\documentclass[a4paper, final]{oxcsproject}

% %%%% BIBLIOGRAPHY SETUP

% The science-type option: numerical in-text citation with references in order of appearance.
\usepackage[style=ieee, sorting=none, backend=biber, doi=false, isbn=false]{biblatex}
\newcommand*{\bibtitle}{References}

% This makes the bibliography left-aligned (not 'justified') and slightly smaller font.
\renewcommand*{\bibfont}{\raggedright\small}

% Change this to the name of your .bib file (usually exported from a citation manager like Zotero
% or EndNote).
\addbibresource{references.bib}


% Uncomment this if you want equation numbers per subsection (2.3.12), instead of per section
% (2.18): \numberwithin{equation}{subsection}

% %%%% TITLE PAGE INFORMATION Project title
\title{Project on a topic in Computer Science}

% The same candidate number as for your exams. You can find it in the student self service.
\candidateno{0000000}

\wordcount{0000}

% NS - What section you're submitting for. Part B for 3rd year, Part C for master's year.
\degree{Part B - MCompSci Computer Science}
% Term and year of submission
\degreedate{Trinity 2024}

% %%%% USEFUL PACKAGES These are some useful packages that are not critical to using this template,
% but some that you may find helpful to look into. Many are demonstrated in this document, but you
% should look into their other features as you go.

% % Load the glossary terms that you've defined in glossary.tex
\input{glossary}

% NS - Allows you to use .svg vector images for your figures, as you should aim to do
\usepackage{svg}

% Useful for consistently formatting numbers with units (e.g., 512 kB, 20 ms, 330 mV, etc.)
\usepackage{siunitx}

% %%%% YOUR PACKAGES This is a good place for you to load and configure any extra packages you're
% using.

% \usepackage{myreallycoolpackage}

% %%%% YOUR OWN PERSONAL MACROS This is a good place to dump your own LaTeX macros as they come up.

% \newcommand{\mycommand}{Hello World!}

% %%%% THE ACTUAL DOCUMENT STARTS HERE
\begin{document}

% JEM: Pages are roman numbered from here, though page numbers are invisible until ToC. This is in
% keeping with most typesetting conventions.
\begin{romanpages}

	% JEM: By default, this template uses the traditional Oxford "Belt Crest". Un-comment the
	% following line to use the newer, "Blue Square" logo:
	% \renewcommand{\crest}{{\includegraphics[width=4.2cm, height=4.2cm]{figures/newlogo.pdf}}}

	% Title page is created here

	% NS - Remember that your title page doesn't count towards your word count
	\maketitle

	% %%%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS -- Nothing to do here except comment out if you don't want it.

	% NS - Similarly, your acknowledgements don't count for your word count
	\begin{acknowledgements}
		\input{text/acknowledgements}
	\end{acknowledgements}

	% %%%% ABSTRACT -- Nothing to do here except comment out if you don't want it.
	\begin{abstract}
		\input{text/abstract}
	\end{abstract}

	% This aligns the bottom of the text of each page. It generally makes things look better.
	\flushbottom

	% NS - Prints out an easy to navigate list of the todos you've left in your document
	\listoftodos

	% This is where the whole-document ToC appears: NS - Again, your table of contents isn't
	% included in your word count
	\tableofcontents

	% %%%% LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS

	% NS - Prints out a list of the acronyms that you've defined in glossary.tex. Just comment it
	% out if you don't want to list the acronyms. You can still use the inline declarations.
	\printglossary[type=\acronymtype]

	% The Roman pages, like the Roman Empire, must come to its inevitable close.
\end{romanpages}

% %%%% SECTIONS Add or remove any sections you'd like here, by file name (excluding '.tex'):
\flushbottom

\include{text/sec1-introduction}
\include{text/sec2-install}
\include{text/sec3-background}
\include{text/sec4-usage}
\include{text/sec5-other-tools}
\include{text/sec6-future-work}

% % APPENDICES %% Starts lettered appendices, adds a heading in table of contents, and adds a page
% that just says "Appendices" to signal the end of your main text.
\startappendices
% Add or remove any appendices you'd like here:
\include{text/appendix-1}
% %%%% REFERENCES

\setlength{\baselineskip}{0pt} % JEM: Single-space References

{\renewcommand*\MakeUppercase[1]{#1}
	\printbibliography[heading=bibintoc,title={\bibtitle}]}
