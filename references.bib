Features Facilities for generating citation keys Automatically generate citation keys without key clashes! Generate citation keys that take into account existing keys in your library even when they are not part of the items you export. Prevent random breakage! Generate citation keys based on contents of your items using citekey formulas. Set your own, stable citation keys, drag and drop LaTeX citations, add other custom BibLaTeX fields. Conversion between formats and encodings Zotero does all its work in UTF-8 Unicode, which is absolutely the right thing to do. Unfortunately, for those shackled to BibTeX and who cannot (yet) move to BibLaTeX, unicode is a major PITA. Also, Zotero supports some simple HTML markup in your items that Bib(La)TeX won’t understand.},

  abstract = {Many applications nowadays use HTTP. HTTP/2, standardised in February 2015, is an improvment of HTTP/1.1. However it is still running on top of TCP/TLS and can thus suffer from performance issues, such as the number of RTTs for the handshake phase and the Head of Line blocking. Google proposed the QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connection) protocol, an user level protocol, running on top of UDP, to solve those issues. Google argues that the response time (Page Load Time) is shorter and thus the end-user experience better. First papers evaluated the intrinsic performances of QUIC, but none compared QUIC with the network, the website structure and the involved actors in mind. In this paper, we present the results of our evaluation, performed on a local testbed as well as on Internet, and our analysis to identify in which conditions QUIC is of interest, which actors can benefit from having QUIC deployed in the network and what impacts QUIC can lead to.},

We propose a novel methodology, which combines real implementation (exploiting virtualization techniques) and simulation, to carry out systematic and repetitive experiments. We modify the default operation of the ns-3 framework and we integrate the dynamism that characterizes satellite communication links, particularly Low Earth Orbit (LEO). We carry out a thorough assessment over different setups, changing the operating frequency band and packet buffer lengths. In addition, we ascertain the impact of using the multi-streaming feature that QUIC integrates. The results show that QUIC yields lower delays than TCP, although it might suffer from higher jitter in particular setups. In addition, the results evince that using multiple streams in QUIC does not yield a relevant gain for the default Round-Robin (RR) scheduler. We propose more appropriate scheduling strategies, which are able to yield better performances with unbalanced traffic. Even if the behavior of transport protocols over non-terrestrial-networks might not be always appropriate, the obtained results evince that QUIC can definitively bring benefits when compared to TCP. Furthermore, we have shown that optimal scheduling policies yields a fairer performance when using multiple flows, having unbalanced traffic loads.},

  abstract = {OPS-SAT is a 3U CubeSat launched on December 18, 2019, it is the first nanosatellite to be directly owned and operated by the European Space Agency (ESA). The spacecraft is a flying platform that is easily accessible to European industry, institutions, and individuals for rapid prototyping, testing, and validation of their software and firmware experiments in space at no cost and no bureaucracy. Equipped with a full set of sensors and actuators, it is conceived to break the “has never flown, will never fly” cycle. OPS-SAT has spearheaded many firsts with in-orbit applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for autonomous operations. AI is of rising interest for space-segment applications despite limited technology demonstrators on-board flying spacecrafts. Past missions have restricted AI to inferring models trained on the ground prior to being uplinked to a spacecraft. This paper presents how the OPS-SAT Flight Control Team (FCT) breaks away from this trend with various AI solutions for in-flight autonomy. Three on-board case studies are presented: 1) image classification with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model inferences using TensorFlow Lite, 2) image clustering with unsupervised learning using k-means, and 3) supervised learning to train a Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery (FDIR) model using online machine learning algorithms. CNN inference with TensorFlow Lite running on-board the spacecraft showcases in-space application of an industry standard open-source solution originally developed for terrestrial edge and mobile computing. Furthermore, the solution is “openable” with an inference pipeline that can be constructed from crowdsourced trained models. This mechanism enables open innovation methods to extend on-board ML beyond its original mission requirement while stimulating knowledge transfer from established AI communities into space applications. Further classification is achieved by re-using an open-source k-means algorithm to cluster images in groups of “cloudiness” and initial results in image segmentation (feature extraction) have promising outlooks. Results from training a FDIR model to protect the spacecraft's camera lens against direct exposure to sunlight are presented, achieving balanced accuracies ranging from 85\% to 99\% from models trained with the Adagarad RDA, AROW, and NHERD online ML algorithms in multi-dimensional input spaces using photodiode diagnostics data stream as training data. The ability to train models in-flight with data generated on-board without human involvement is an exciting first that stimulates a significant rethink on how future missions can be designed.},

QUIC is an evolving transport-layer protocol that has been developed to reduce Web latency, integrate security features, and enable a high-quality experience for mobile users. However, few systematic experimental studies have been carried out to evaluate users' service in a realistic mobile environment. In this work, we describe the design of experiments with QUIC and HTTP/3, which is based on QUIC, also considering benchmarks and variants in QUIC's implementations. We report our measurements collected from real mobile networks with the pan-European MONROE platform. Using data from the application, transport, and network layers in different wireless environments, we experimentally investigate and compare the performance of QUIC and HTTP/3 for static and mobile cellular users of several networks across Europe. Initial results show that QUIC-based operations are advantageous in case of users that move, and they are also strongly affected by the congestion control algorithm chosen for QUIC.},

  abstract = {Many signaling protocols in IP networks need a protection against message loss, but they do not require a strict in-sequence data delivery. Since TCP provides reliable in-order transport, end-to-end delays may be unnecessarily increased due to head-of-line blocking. An alternative transport protocol is SCTP, which is optimized for signaling applications and provides mechanisms for reliable, partial-ordered or unordered message delivery. In this paper, we quantify the impact of head-of-line blocking on the response time of transaction-based signaling applications. In order to mitigate this problem, we compare different solutions based on TCP and SCTP. Both a new analytical model and measurements on state-of-the-art operating systems show to which extend SCTP can improve transport delays by leveraging transmission over multiple parallel streams or using unordered data delivery. Our analysis reveals that using one or multiple parallel TCP connections can result in much higher end-to-end delays, even for moderate packet loss probabilities. We also observe significant differences in the TCP performance of different operating systems.},

It is expected to have an evaluation of the complete SCPS protocol suite in a realistic space environment with a large bandwidth-delay product (BDP). In this paper, we present an experimental performance evaluation of SCPS suite, by comparing with standard TCP/IP, over the NASA's Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) high speed links with data rate up to 4 Mb/s.},

  abstract = {As the transport layer protocol of the Space Communication Protocol Standard (SCPS) suite, SCPS-Transport Protocol (SCPS-TP) is actually transmission control protocol (TCP), with a set of extensions aimed at improving TCP performance in space communications. Some work has been done on the performance evaluation of SCPS-TP in comparison with TCP. However, those works have been done by testing SCPS-TP via emulation test-beds. We present the file transfer experimental work of testing the SCPS protocol stack over NASA's geostationary orbit (GEO) Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS). Considering that space communication channels in practice are frequently asymmetric in terms of channel bandwidth, our work is concentrated on the evaluation of the effectiveness of SCPS-TP in coping with channel rate asymmetry. We conclude that SCPS-TP is better suited than TCP over long-delayed, asymmetric, satellite channels with a throughput advantage of over 30 Kbyte/s for the transmission of a 10 Mbyte file. A hybrid of the channel rate control and acknowledgment frequency reduction mechanisms makes significant contributions to the performance enhancement of SCPS-TP over asymmetric space channels.},

  abstract = {In consideration of future significant number of network satellites orbiting in various heights and trajectories, there is a new trend that network protocols designed for current satellites might give way to protocols that dominate terrestrial networks for better adaption in scale as well as integration of future Internet. QUIC, a novel and experimental transport layer protocol, implemented by Google and designed for a quicker HTTP service has proved itself in the market and QUIC outperformed TCP most in environment with a long latency and high packet loss, which is the main feature in space. However, there is a lack of research that studies QUIC's performance in space networks. This paper focuses on QUIC's performance in space-terrestrial integrated networks compared with TCP and its modification. For this purpose, we design a concise space network with both LEO and GEO satellites involved, covering different kinds of transmission scenarios. Simulation of the network is divided into several parts, decision of different satellites' orbit parameters, real-time visibility data calculated through Satellite Tool Kit(STK), communication modeling in MATLAB and finally network conditions converted. Related data were then input in a real testbed for transport performance comparison among QUIC, TCP(Cubic Reno) and TCP with ECN enabled. The semi-physical experiment demonstrates that QUIC outperforms TCP in all experiment cases through the analysis of page load time (PLT), which shows the potential that network issues in space settled with terrestrial solutions.},
