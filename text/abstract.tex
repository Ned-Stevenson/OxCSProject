OxCSProject is a \LaTeX\ template intended to encourage you to become familiar with using \LaTeX,
give you a helpful starting point when it comes to structuring your project report, and ensure
that you have easy and consistent formatting for your project. OxCSProject is an adaptation of
very helpful work done by those intending to serve the same purpose as OxCSProject in different
aspects of Oxford academic life, and would not exist without them.

OxCSProject is also designed to be an introduction into the basic tools that I expect you'll find
helpful throughout the process of writing your report, as well as introduce you to other tools
that you may appreciate being aware of. Lastly, ways for the value of OxCSProject to be enhanced
are laid out, so that you can contribute any additional development for future students to enjoy.
