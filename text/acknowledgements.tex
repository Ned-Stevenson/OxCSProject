You might want to thank your supervisor or anyone else who supported your project, your friends or
family who stayed up at night to keep you company, or the guy at your favourite coffee shop who
you saw more often than you saw your own feet.

I'd like to thank my supervisors for encouraging me to explore the power of \LaTeX\ and John
McManigle for providing such an effective and helpful starting point for this template.
